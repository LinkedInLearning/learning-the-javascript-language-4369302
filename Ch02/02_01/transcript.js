// Naming variables
    // Variable names are pretty flexible as long as you follow a few rules:
        // Start them with a letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.
        // After the first letter, you can use numbers, as well as letters, underscores, or dollar signs.
        // Don’t use any of JavaScript’s reserved keywords.
